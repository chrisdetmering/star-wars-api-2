## Summary
This is the third project I have built for my portfolio. I did not use any tutorials while creating this app.
The app pulls character data from the Star Wars API and presents that data in a table format. The user is able to search for a character and any matches will be displayed.

#How I am going to do this
#Go though step by step 
#I will pause the video
#Take brakes 


#Good 
#1.Breaking up Code (App)
#2.moving functions outside of Functional Component Body > a new function is made on each re-render (App)

#Focus: Simplicity
#1. Naming > CamelCase (conventions) + No abbreviation (Andy) (done)
#2. Unnecessary conditional check in Table.jsx  > Simpler (done)
#3. Math.ceil in getNumberOfButtons(props) > Simpler (done)
#4. change where you call getNumberOfButtons in generateButton(props) > Processing (done)
#5. Change generateButton to createButtons > Naming (done)
#6. Simplify all the functions called in getCharacters > Simplicity 
#7. Simplify functions to just being four: getCharacters, handleSearchButtonClick, handlePageButtonClick and handleSearchTermChange > Simplicity/Single Source of Truth
